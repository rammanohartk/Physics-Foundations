# **Vectors**

## 1. Definition: 

- Quantity that possesses both magnitude and direction, and transforms in a specific way under change of coordinates.
 
##  2. Physical significance :

Vectors help to describe quantities independent of  our point of view.
Vector helps in packaging multidimensional information into a single structure object.
Examples :
- Position and Displacemnt
- Velocity and Acceleration
- Force and Momentum
- Electric and Magnetic Fields etc.
               
## 3. Insights:

Coordinate Invariance: Although components of vector changes under rotations or transformation, the length and direction remains same.
The physical reality doesnot depend on how we label the space. 
Zero vector: Only vector with no direction. Represents rest or equilibrium physical states.
 
## 4. Mathematical Structure:

A vector is an element in vector space over a field, equipped with operations.

A vector space satisfies:
- Closure property under addition and scalar multiplication
- Associativity
- Existance of Zero vector and additive inverse 
Here zero vector acts as additive identity and represents the absence of displacement or effect in physical systems.
   
## 5. Geometric Interpretation:

It is usually represented as and arrow, but mathematically it is an abstract object independent of visualization.
     
Geometrically a vector represents:
- Displacement in space
- Directional flow 
- Orientation

## 6. Coordinate Representation

In a chosen basis {x,y,z} a vector can be written as,
  
$$
v = v_1x + v_2y + v_3z
$$ 

The $v_i$ are components of a vector.
   
The components depends on the chose of basis, but geometric vector does not.
   
## 7. Transformation 

If a basis change via a transformation matrix R then components transform as :

$$    
\vec{v'}= R\vec{v}
$$

The numerical components change but physical vector remains invariant.
This property ensures that physical laws under vectors are independent of coordinate systems.
    
## Vectors are arrow of reality that stays physically true regardless of change in coordinate systems.
