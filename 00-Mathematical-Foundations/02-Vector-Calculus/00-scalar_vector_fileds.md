# Scalar and Vector Fields

## Mathematical definition:

A scalar field assigns a scalar value to every point in space

$$
f : R^3 \rightarrow R
$$

eg: $ T(x,y,z) = 3 $

A vector field assigns a vector to every point in space

$$
F : R^3 \rightarrow R^3
$$

eg: $ F(x,y,z) = (F_x,F_y,F_z)  $

## Geometric Interpretation:

Scalar field:
- each point has only magnitude (like height on a landscape)
- no direction

Vector Field:
- each point has magnitude and direction(arrows attched to everypoints)
- direction everywhere

## Physical Meaning 

### Scalar Field 

Scalar field describes state.

It represents quantities without direction
- temperature field
- electric potential
- pressure
- density

### Vector Fields

Vector field describes flow or force
 
It represents directional quantities
- electric field
- magnetic field
- force field
- heat flux

## My thoughts:

Vector calculus is all about fields. Fields can be considered as the language of physics. Fields describe the true structure of space. We can convert between these two fields using operators and fields are very important to understand before we talk about operators.
