# **Vectors**
 1. Definition:  Quantity that possesses both magnitude and direction, and transforms in a specific way under change of coordinates.
 
 2. Physical significance :
        Vectors help to describe quantities independent of  our point of view.
        Vector helps in packaging multidimensional information into a single structure object.
     Examples :
               Position and Displacemnt
               Velocity and Acceleration
               Force and Momentum
               Electric and Magnetic Fields etc.
               
3. Insights:
 Coordinate Invariance: Although components of vector changes under rotations or transformation, the length and direction remains same. 
                        The physical reality doesnot depend on how we label the sace.
 Zero vector: Only vector with no direction Represents rest or equilibrium physical states.
 
4. Mathematical Structure:
    A vector is an element in vector space over a field, equipped with operations.
    A vector space satisfies -
                              Closure property under addition and scalar multiplication
                              Associativity
                              Existance of Zero vector and additive inverse 
                              
   Here zero vector acts as additive identity and represents the absence of displacement or effect in physical systems.
   
5. Geometric Interpretation:
     It is usually represented as and arrow, but mathematically it is an abstract object independent of visualization.
     Geometrically a vector represents -
                                        Displacement in space
                                        Directional flow 
                                        Orientation
6. Coordinate Representation
  In a chosen basis {x,y,z} a vector can be written as,
        v = v(sub)1(/sub)x + v(sub)2(/sub)y + v(sub)3(/sub)z
   The v(sub)i(/sub) are components of a vector.
   The components depends on the chose of basis, but geometric vector does not.
7. Transformation 
    If a basis change via a transformation matrix R then components transform as :
                v'= Rv
    The numerical components change but physical vector remains invariant.
    This property ensures that physical lwas under vectors are independent of coordinate systems.
    
                
                

## Vectors are arrow of reality that stays physically true regardless of change in coordinate systems.
